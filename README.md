# Simulation of a Radiator in a body of water using Numerical Methods
A working model of a radiator in a body of water that outputs heat flux and temperature at all points in the system. This was produced by solving an advection-diffusion governing PDE, implementing iterative checkerboarding methods and applying boundary conditions.
